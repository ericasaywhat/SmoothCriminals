# Smooth criminals: agent-based modeling of street crime

Erica Lee and Emily Yeh

### Abstract

We design and implement an agent-based model of citizens in a simulated world we call CrimeWorld, where each citizen has their own characteristics and behavioral rules, including the citizenâ€™s likelihood of committing crimes. This version of CrimeWorld includes clearly visible police, which deter criminals. Comparing our results to those of Groff in Simulation for theory testing and experimentation, we observe that our results behave qualitatively similarly. We then extend Groff's experiment by implementing a CrimeWorld with punishment for committing crimes. This CrimeWorld includes undercover police, who punish criminals if they catch them by taking away a large proportion of their wealth, thereby affecting their motivations to commit crimes. This experiment is still in progress, but our hypothesis is that the rate of crime will increase in this version of CrimeWorld because losing wealth will motivate the criminals to commit more crimes.

### Introduction

The idea behind routine activity theory (RAT) is that if the frequency of convergence between offenders, guardians, and targets increases, crime rates may increase even if the absolute number of motivated offenders remains constant. In other words, as individuals spend more time away from home, crime rates increase. We'll explore RAT by simulating many `Citizens` inside of a `CrimeWorld`.

In our simulated world, `CrimeWorld`, there are two types of agents: police officers and regular citizens. Regular citizens can have a variety of roles: some are offenders (agents who commit crimes), some are guardians (agents who prevent crimes), and some are targets (agents against whom crimes are committed).

#### Deciding to commit crimes

According to Groff's experiment<sup>2</sup>, variety of factors affect an offender's decision to commit a crime. Consider several agents at a single node; some might be police, some might be guardians, and some might be offenders trying to find a guardian to make into a target. The first factor the offenders must consider is whether there are police at the node. The presence of a police officer is an absolute dealbreaker; no crimes may be committed in the presence of authority.

If there are no police officers, however, the second factor the offenders must consider is the guardianship of other agents present - a variable represented by `G`.

##### `G = (N`<sub>agents</sub>` - 2) + P`

`G` depends on two other variables. `N`<sub>agents</sub> is the total number of agents present at a given node, and we subtract 2 to account for the offender and their potential target. `P` is a randomly selected number between -2 and 2 that represents the offender's perception of the capability of the guardians who are present.

If `G < 1`, the offender determines that there are not capable guardians present, so they should commit the crime.

If `G == 1`, the offender isn't sure if there are capable guardians present, so they make a random decision to commit the crime.

And finally, if `G > 1`, the offender determines that there are capable guardians present and they should not commit the crime.

Now, let's assume `G <= 1` and the offender has decided to commit the crime. Which agent should the offender offend? The offender must consider the suitability of the potential targets in the node, a variable we'll call `S`.

##### `S = (W`<sub>target</sub>` - W`<sub>offender</sub>`) + P`

`S` depends on several other variables. `W`<sub>target</sub> is the wealth of the potential target and `W`<sub>offender</sub> is the wealth of the offender. And like our equation for `G`, `P` represents a randomly selected number, this time between -1 and 1, which represents the offender's perception of the wealth of the target.

If `S >= 0`, the offender determines that the target is suitably wealthy and robs them.

If `S < 0`, the offender determines that the target is not suitably wealthy, so they move on to the next potential target in the node.

Figure 1 below shows our simulation's results as a distribution of robberies across `CrimeWorld`.

Cohen and Felson introduce the idea of routine activity theory in which they state that crime is not affected by social causes such as poverty or unemployment. They focus on the circumstances under which an individual carries out a crime. During their time, the conventional theories of crime was unable to explain why crime rates increased post World War II since the economy was on the rise. Their routine activity theory states that there was more crime post WWII since people were generally more wealthy and there was more to steal.

This paper presents a new approach to testing the routine activity theory. The routine activity theory is a criminology subfield developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence E. Cohen. Routine activity theory is based on the premise that crime is committed regardless of social causes such as poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Some crimes that are well modelled by routine activity theory is copyright infringement, peer-to-peer file sharing, corporate crime, etc. The author of this paper, Elizabeth R. Groff, uses agent-based modelling to model street robbery since it involves the interaction of agents in a public place and is driven by economic gain, making it more of a rational decision than a crime such as assault. A wide variety of studies from surveys of individuals to macro and micro level data to represent routine activity in society. However, all of these studies struggled with separating constructs and accurately replicating crime patterns. Rather than the usual top-down approach, agent-based modelling is a bottom up approach that starts with individuals with characteristics and behavioural rules already implemented. This model introduces a new framework for more complete and rigourous tests of theories. It clearly supports the possibility of the basic premise of routine activity theory.

Malleson et. al. introduce a model in which they simulate burglaries that happen within an environment where the burglars' need to acquire wealth fluctuates with their need to sleep (so it decreases when they are tired and increases after they sleep). The authors find that burglary rates increase in certain areas in their model, leading them to suspect that if these areas had increased security, the rates of burglaries would decrease. Altering the security in different environments produces different burglary rates and community types within 50 days (according to the simulation's timeline). We think that this article would provide an interesting basis for an extension to Groff's experiment, in which we might implement exhaustion as a property of crime-committing agents and simulate areas with higher or lower security to observe how these agents behave under varying circumstances.
