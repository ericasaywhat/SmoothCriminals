# Review: A Multiple-Agent Based Model of Evacuation
Emily Yeh

### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The experiment you're replicating involves simulating the behaviors that people trying to evacuate a room might have, like panicking or jamming. The question it answers probably sounds something like "How would a simulation of people escaping a room look like?" The explanation is pretty clear, or maybe it's just easy to understand because it's a behavior that people are familiar with.

### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I think I kind of understand the methodology, but you might need to explain it more. Based on the black and yellow figures, I'm guessing each agent is a yellow dot of a variable size and the little line coming out of the dot is its direction, which is homing towards the door, and the dot moves with some velocity. Tell me more, though! Are all the agents moving at the same speed? Does the size of the agent matter?

### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I'm guessing you don't have results yet, which is okay. (Unless the sample plot output is your results?) The sample plot output confuses me a little bit, since I don't quite know what the Y-axis is.

### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

I think you haven't finished the experiment yet, so you haven't interpreted anything yet - and that's okay. This line, "As agents wanted to move faster, they caused more conflicts in the doorway, slowing the system down.", makes sense to me, though; just make sure you support it with your results. Also, emphasize how surprising this is! The faster people leave, the slower they actually leave?? That's definitely something you should discuss and explain.

### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?

As far as I can tell, the results you're going to get will be consistent with the results from the original paper. I kind of hope that you'll consider modeling injured people if you do have time later (probably not very likely), since that would be an interesting result to comment on.

### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

I think the extension you suggest makes sense and has the potential to answer a new and surprising question. Putting a barrier in front of the door will make people leave faster? That'll be interesting for sure!

### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

I think that your replication is substantially complete, right? You were able to interpret your results, even though there aren't any in the report, so I'm guessing you did at least finish running the experiment. Your extension also looks like it's getting to be completed, or it's at least successfully set up.

### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

Be careful when you interject personal opinions, like in the absract where you add "(surprisingly)". It might be surprising, for sure, but I think Allen probably wouldn't appreciate it.

Also, I don't know if you intend to keep the Interpretation section separate from the other sections, but maybe it would make more sense just to incorporate your interpretations into your results section? (Will your Reproduction and Extension sections both have an Interpretation section? If not, I think you should just keep your interpretations in the same sections that the results are in.)

### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Yep, everything looks to be in order. Your last biblio item isn't bolded like the rest of them, but that's all.
