# Review of Adam Novotny and Changjun Lim's "A Multiple-Agent Based Model of Evacuation"

#### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The team is modelling evacuation in pedestrians. The team's explanation of the experiment is pretty clear, but there is no clear question that is addressed. I do understand, though, that the model is intended to explore evacuation and what makes evacuation more chaotic and how to make it better. It introduces things such as obstacles and panic.

#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The methodology is pretty clear and makes sense for experiment. Every agent tries to keep away from the walls and each other as they make their way to the exit. There is also friction with the walls and each other. By introducing an obstacle in front of the door in this environment, they can still measure the effect that has on evacuation time. 

#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The figure provided is a result, but it, while lacking a label for the y-axis, is pretty clear in what it is conveying. The figures depicting the agents in the room is very clear in visualizing the environment as well as any bottlenecking that occur. An animation may be more clear, but since this is a report, perhaps frames of different moments in the evacuation may or may not be helpful. 

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

There is not much interpretation done in the report. 

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how?

I think the replication, while not complete, should be consistent with the results from the original paper at least qualitatively, if not quantitatively.
#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

From the report, we can see that the extensions include adding a barrier in front of the exit and adding panic to the agents. It isn’t really clear how panic will be implemented, but I’m assuming it has to do with making the agents act quicker and collide with other agents more.

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

I don’t think the team will have trouble implementing the rest of the extension code wise, but the report needs some more work and results.

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

The report, as it is, is written in clear, concise, and correct language. It is consistent with the audience and goals of the report and doesn’t currently violate any of the recommendations in Allen’s style guide.

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

The report is in the right directory with the right file name. It’s formatted professionally in Markdown and includes a meaningful title that tells us what the team is modelling. It also includes the full names of the authors. The bibliography is in an acceptable style.
