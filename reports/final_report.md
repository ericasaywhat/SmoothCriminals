# Smooth criminals: agent-based modeling of street crime

Erica Lee and Emily Yeh

## Abstract

We design and implement an agent-based model of citizens in a simulated world we call CrimeWorld, where each citizen has their own characteristics and behavioral rules, including the citizen’s likelihood of committing crimes. This version of CrimeWorld includes clearly visible police which deter criminals. Comparing our results to those of Groff in her report, *Simulation for theory testing and experimentation*, we observe that our results behave qualitatively similarly. We then extend Groff's experiment by implementing a CrimeWorld with punishment for committing crimes. This CrimeWorld includes undercover police, who punish criminals if they catch them by taking away a large proportion of their wealth, thereby affecting their motivations to commit crimes. This experiment is still in progress, but our hypothesis is that the rate of crime will increase in this version of CrimeWorld, which is counter-intuitive since punishment is typically intended to lower the rate of crime.

## I. Introduction

Research consistently shows that people living in poverty commit more crimes than people living in high-income households.<sup>6</sup> This can be due to a variety of factors, such as employment accessibility, residential instability, and general distrust, but the most commonly cited factor is income and wealth inequality<sup>8</sup> which is the factor we investigate in our model. Our model is based off of one generated by Groff,<sup>5</sup> in which agents interact in a world based on various rules: no crimes may be committed in the presence of authority, and criminals only commit crimes if certain conditions, which are described in subsection A, are satisfied. In our model, the agents are called Citizens and they inhabit a graph-like world called CrimeWorld, where each node is a street intersection. Each Citizen has several behaviors: they spend approximately 8 hours (the length of a work day) of their day moving around randomly in CrimeWorld, after which they return to their designated home and "sleep." They move randomly in one of the four cardinal directions for each time step. They can have two different roles: some Citizens are offenders (agents who commit crimes) and some are police (agents who prevent crimes). The offender agents share sets of characteristics, and for each time step, these characteristics help to determine whether they commit a crime or not. We will explain the decision-making process that offenders go through in *Subsection 1A*.

We would like to acknowledge that we base our model off of Groff's<sup>5</sup> model, as opposed to replicating it completely. This is because Groff's model is built on the routine activity theory, which asserts that if the frequency of convergence between offenders, guardians, and targets increases, crime rates may increase even if the absolute number of motivated offenders remains constant. In other words, as individuals spend more time away from home, crime rates increase. Since we are not interested in creating a model based on this theory, but rather creating as accurate a model of crime as possible, we decided to use the parts of Groff's model that are relevant to this goal and unrelated to routine activity theory, leaving out the rest.

### A. How do crimes occur?

For each time step, 20% of Citizens have the potential to commit a crime. This proportion is based on data cited by Groff, which states that the proportion of civilians who have committed a crime in Seattle is approximately 20%.<sup>9</sup> If one of these Citizens' wealth is negative, however, they automatically commit the crime, instead of going through the decision-making process explained below. Citizens who are at home during a given time step cannot rob others, nor can they be robbed.

According to Groff's experiment,<sup>5</sup> a variety of factors affect an offender's decision to commit a crime. Consider several agents at a single node; some might be police and the rest might be offenders trying to find a target amongst each other. The first factor the offenders must consider is whether there are police at the node, since no crimes may be committed in the presence of a police officer. However, if there are no police officers, the offenders must consider several other factors, which are summarized in Figure 1.

![decision tree](https://github.com/ericasaywhat/SmoothCriminals/blob/master/reports/decision_tree.png)

*Figure 1. An offender's decision tree<sup>5</sup>; how an offender decides whether to commit a crime.*

As Figure 1 indicates, if there are no police officers in a node, the second factor the offenders must consider is the guardianship of other agents present - a variable represented by `G`.

#### `G = (N`<sub>agents</sub>` - 2) + P`

`G` depends on two other variables. `N`<sub>agents</sub> is the total number of agents present at a given node, and 2 is subtracted from this total to account for the offender and their potential target. `P` is a randomly selected number between -2 and 2 that represents the offender's perception of the capability of the other citizens who are present. If `G < 1`, the offender determines that there are not enough capable guardians present, so they should commit a crime. If `G == 1`, the offender is unsure if there are capable guardians present, and so makes a random decision to commit the crime. And finally, if `G > 1`, the offender determines that there are capable guardians present and they should therefore not commit the crime.

Now, assume `G <= 1` and the offender has decided to commit the crime. Which agent should the offender offend? The offender finds the wealthiest person in that node and robs that person. **PUT S BACK IN HERE OR SO HELP ME (also explain why we didn't really use it)**

### B. Results of our initial model

After running simulations using our model, we generate the following figures to show the spatial distribution of crimes committed. For reference, the figures Groff generates in her own experiment are also shown.

*Figure 2.2. The distributions of crimes across CrimeWorld for 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 steps.*

Figures 2.1 and 2.2 display the spatial distribution of crimes committed across Seattle and CrimeWorld, respectively. In Figure 2.1, the distribution of crimes in Groff's model shows that there is an area of higher crimes committed that emerges where there is a bottleneck present in the map, and where the nodes are the most dense. This figure is generated using varying randomization conditions, which are based on the amount of time the agents in the model spend away from home (from 30% to 70%) to support Groff's investigation into routine activity theory. Figure 2.2 displays our model's results, which are not based on randomization conditions nor routine activity theory, but rather time steps. Similar to Figure 2.1, Figure 2.2 shows that there are dark areas of CrimeWorld where more crimes are committed, which darken as more time passes. These dark areas are close to clusters where Citizens live, since they return to their homes regularly.

For the purposes of measuring how closely our model matches Groff's, we also find the mean difference between the number of crimes committed for various conditions relating to how much time each Citizen spends away from their home. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show Groff's results and our results, respectively.

| I   | J   | Mean Difference (I - J) |
| --- | --- | ---                     |
| 0.3 | 0.4 | -4.73                   |
| 0.3 | 0.5 | -10.91                  |
| 0.3 | 0.6 | -15.42                  |
| 0.3 | 0.7 | -19.78                  |
| 0.4 | 0.5 | -6.19                   |
| 0.4 | 0.6 | -10.69                  |
| 0.4 | 0.7 | -15.05                  |
| 0.5 | 0.6 | -4.51                   |
| 0.5 | 0.7 | -8.86                   |
| 0.6 | 0.7 | -4.36                   |

*Figure 3.2. A comparison of the average number of robberies per node for different percentages of time away from home in our model.*

From Figure 3, we observe that the differences in the average numbers of robberies in CrimeWorld for varying times away from home quantitatively differ from that of Groff's implementation. This is likely due to the fact that her simulation takes into account the shape and neighborhoods of Seattle, and because Groff runs her simulations for a year's worth of time, whereas we run ours for about 30 days due to time limitations. Qualitatively, however, the differences in average number of robberies in Crimeworld follow the pattern of that in Groff's simulation; if we multiply each value we obtain by a factor between 3 and 5, we output values that are the same as Groff's. For example, for `I=0.3` and `J=0.4`, the mean difference is -21.39 in Groff's experiment and -4.73 in ours. If we multiply our result by 4.52, however, our result matches Groff's. Similarly, for `I=0.3` and `J=0.5`, the mean difference is -40.58 in Groff's experiment and -10.91 in ours. Again, if we multiply our result by 3.72, our result matches Groff's. We summarize the factoral differences between our results and Groff's in Figure 4.

| I   | J   | Our Mean Difference | Groff's Mean Difference | Factor Difference (Groff's / Our Results) |
| --- | --- | ---                 | ---                     | ---                                       |

| 0.4 | 0.6 | -10.69              | -42.05                  | 3.93                                      |

## III. A CrimeWorld full of punishment

Our version of CrimeWorld, as implemented according to Groff's experiment, does not include punishment for committing crimes. In fact, when an offender decides whether to commit a crime in a node, they also consider whether there are any police agents in the node, and if so, the offender simply does not rob anyone, effectively avoiding punishment. We propose a version of CrimeWorld where offenders do get punished if they are caught committing crime. We hypothesize that this version of CrimeWorld will result in higher crime rates and more overall crimes committed. In this CrimeWorld full of punishment, we increase the motivation of offenders who commit crimes successfully and decrease the motivation of offenders who are caught while committing crimes.

We hypothesize that when deterrence in the form of punishment is introduced to CrimeWorld, the number of crimes committed will increase. This contradicts the rationale behind deterrence, which is that when an offender is punished, the frequency and likelihood of future offenses is reduced.<sup>2</sup> The reasoning behind our hypothesis is that the factors that drive offenders to commit crimes outweigh the factors that deter them; successfully committing a crime and needing more wealth both contribute to an offender's motivation to commit crime, while only being caught lowers that motivation. Furthermore, people in a state where they cannot afford the necessary living expenses of their location any longer are more likely to turn to crime in order to improve their situations, since they have little left to lose.

#### In CrimeWorld 2.0, citizens start out with different wealths and each have different incomes. There will also be citizens who have wealth but don't have a job, so they do not have income, as well as citizens, who don't start out with wealth but have a steady income. CrimeWorld 2.0 also implements a cost of living. INSERT NUMBERS AND CITE. The police officers here will be undercover and if a crime is committed while the police officer is in that node, the citizens will be punished. We run the simulation for two different types of pushishments: a set fine for every offender and a fine that is proportional to how wealthy the offender is.

#### Since we now have punishment, CrimeWorld 2.0 includes motivation, in which motivation increases faster the less wealth the citizen has. Motivation is also reliant on how many times the citizen has been punished as well as how many times the citizen has successfully committed a crime.

![formula](https://github.com/ericasaywhat/SmoothCriminals/blob/master/reports/formula.png)

#### When a robbery is committed, the motivation is recalculated with a formula that takes into account the number of times the offender successfully or unsuccessfully commits a crime. The more successful crimes committed, the less their motivation decreases when caught. If the offender is caught committing a crime but the number of their successes exceed failures to commit a crime, their motivation isn't recalculated but instead decreased. If the offender isn't caught committing a crime and their successes don't exceed their failures, their motivation is still recalculated to take those numbers into account. Likewise, if the offender is not caught committing the crime but the number of their failures exceed successes to commit a crime, their motivation isn't recalculated but instead increased. If the offender is caught committing the crime and their successes exceeds their failures, their motivation is still recalculated to take those numbers into account.

![proportions](https://github.com/ericasaywhat/SmoothCriminals/blob/master/reports/punishment_ratio.png)


**INSERT INTERPRETATIONS HERE**
#### In comparing Figures 4 and 5, we can see that CrimeWorld 2.0 has the lowest amount of crime at a set fine value of 80. Otherwise, CrimeWorld 2.0 is better off without punishment. Figure 5 demonstrates an unexpected behaviour of periodic rises and falls. There is an overall increase in the number of robberies, but at punishment ratios of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 the number of robberies drop.

This paper presents a new approach to testing the routine activity theory. The routine activity theory is a criminology subfield developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence E. Cohen. Routine activity theory is based on the premise that crime is committed regardless of social causes such as poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Some crimes that are well modelled by routine activity theory is copyright infringement, peer-to-peer file sharing, corporate crime, etc. The author of this paper, Elizabeth R. Groff, uses agent-based modelling to model street robbery since it involves the interaction of agents in a public place and is driven by economic gain, making it more of a rational decision than a crime such as assault. A wide variety of studies from surveys of individuals to macro and micro level data to represent routine activity in society. However, all of these studies struggled with separating constructs and accurately replicating crime patterns. Rather than the usual top-down approach, agent-based modelling is a bottom up approach that starts with individuals with characteristics and behavioural rules already implemented. This model introduces a new framework for more complete and rigourous tests of theories. It clearly supports the possibility of the basic premise of routine activity theory.

For the period 2008–12: Persons in poor households at or below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) (39.8 per 1,000) had more than double the rate of violent victimization as persons in high-income households (16.9 per 1,000). Persons in poor households had a higher rate of violence involving a firearm (3.5 per 1,000) compared to persons above the FPL (0.8–2.5 per 1,000). The overall pattern of poor persons having the highest rates of violent victimization was consistent for both whites and blacks.

Malleson et. al. introduce a model in which they simulate burglaries that happen within an environment where the burglars' need to acquire wealth fluctuates with their need to sleep (so it decreases when they are tired and increases after they sleep). The authors find that burglary rates increase in certain areas in their model, leading them to suspect that if these areas had increased security, the rates of burglaries would decrease. Altering the security in different environments produces different burglary rates and community types within 50 days (according to the simulation's timeline). We think that this article would provide an interesting basis for an extension to Groff's experiment, in which we might implement exhaustion as a property of crime-committing agents and simulate areas with higher or lower security to observe how these agents behave under varying circumstances.
